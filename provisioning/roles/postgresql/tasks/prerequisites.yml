# REVIEW: it is kind of a chore to have to install `setuptools`
#         just to get `easy_install` and use it to fetch the latest
#         `pip` (which is way newer than the distro `python-pip`).
#
#         Could we default on the distro pip? Does that conflict
#         with an easy_installed pip later on? Could we just assume
#         that pip is installed and carry on?
